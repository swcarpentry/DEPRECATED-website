<p>
  To complete the boot camp you will need
  a web browser,
  the Unix Bash shell,
  the Git version control system (or Subversion or Mercurial, if your instructor is using them instead),
  a code editor (though any plain text editor will work in a pinch),
  and either a scientific Python installation that includes
  the <a href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html">IPython Notebook</a>,
  <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">NumPy</a>,
  and <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>,
  or a full-featured installation of R.
  You may also need
  a simple database manager called <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>,
  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a>
  or other software specific to your boot camp.
</p>
<p>
  This page explains how to install this software.
  Please make sure you install everything before coming to your boot camp
  so that teaching can begin right away.
  (Wireless networks usually can't cope with 20 people trying to download these packages at the same time...)
  If you run into any problems,
  please let your boot camp organizer know as soon as possible.
</p>
<div align="center">
  <strong>
    You do <em>not</em> need to install everything list below,
    since some packages are alternatives to one another.
    <br/>
    Your instructor will let you know
    exactly which packages will be used in the boot camp you are attending.

  <h2>Using a Virtual Machine</h2>
  <p>
    The easiest way for us to provide you with a consistent, pre-configured environment
    is to give you a Linux virtual machine.  You can use this virtual machine
    from Windows, OS X, or even another Linux install.
    Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>
    and download
    <a href="http://files.software-carpentry.org/swc_lubuntu.ova">this virtual machine image</a>
    (<a href="http://is.gd/MosNIh">alternate download</a>).
    Load the VM into VirtualBox by doing <code>Import Appliance</code>
    and loading the <code>.ova</code> file.
  </p>

<section id="native">
  <h2>Native Installation</h2>
  <p>
    Many people prefer to install software directly on their machine
    so that it is integrated with their usual desktop environment.
    Even if you plan to do this,
    please download VirtualBox and the virtual machine as a backup&mdash;it
    can be difficult to get everything set up correctly on older machines.)
  </p>
  <p>
    For Windows users:
    The <a href="https://raw.github.com/swcarpentry/boot-camps/master/setup/swc-windows-installer.py">Software Carpentry Installer</a>
    installs several of the packages described below.
    Save the file to your hard drive,
    then double-click on the file to run it.

      R is an extensible system and many people share useful code they have developed as a package via CRAN and GitHub.
      To install a package,
      for example the <a href="http://plyr.had.co.nz"><code>plyr</code> package</a> for data aggregation,
      here is one way to do it in the R console (there are others):
    </p>
<pre>{r, eval=FALSE, results="hide"}
install.packages("plyr", dependencies = TRUE)</pre>
    <p>
      Another package you may wish to play around with is
      <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a>,
      which facilitates the creation of dynamic reports.
