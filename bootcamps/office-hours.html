<h4>Upcoming Office Hours</h4>

<p><b>Office hours</b> are regular events for learners, who have gone through a
Bootcamp with us, to get one-on-one help from Software Carpentry instructors,
online.  It's a chance to ask questions from your day-to-day scientific
computing work ("stupid" questions encouraged!).  For example, you might be
stuck on a bit of <a href="{{root_path}}/4_0/shell/index.html">shell</a> or <a
href="{{root_path}}/4_0/python/index.html">python</a> scripting. Or perhaps you
would <em>like</em> to write a script to automate something but want help
figuring out how to begin. These are all great things to ask at office
hours.</p>
 
<p>Here's how it works:</p>
<ol>
 <li><b>(Optional) Register for an upcoming office hours session.</b>  
     Registering lets us know how many people to expect, and to send you a reminder email. </li>

 <li><b>During the office hours times, visit the web address for the office hour.</b>
     Think of this like the "hall way" outside of the office.  Here you can chat with
     the instructors and others who are waiting.
        <div style="text-align:center"><img
        src="{{root_path}}/img/screenshots/office-hours-etherpad.png"
        class="img-rounded" style="text-align:center;"/></div>
     </li>

 <li><b>Get started.</b> You and your instructor will sort out how best to carry out the tutoring:
     over chat, video conferencing (e.g. Skype, Google Hangout), screen sharing,
     a shared whiteboard, etc.  See below for setup instructions some of the
     tools we've found to work, and that you may need to setup.</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<a id="setup"></a><h2>Software Setup</h2>
The following are tools we've found work well across operating systems, and
which instructors will have experience using. 

<h3>Google+ Hangout</h3>
<p><b>Google+ Hangout</b> provides video, voice, and text chat, as well as
screensharing and shared whiteboarding.</p>

<p>To use it, you'll need a <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signup">Google+
account</a>.  If you already have an account you can use it, or if privacy is
concern you can always create an account just to use during the office
hours.</p>

<p>When you first attempt to start a "Hangout" (i.e. video/audio chat), you'll be
prompted to <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/hangoutplugin">install the
Hangout plugin</a>.</p>

<h3>Skype</h3>
<p><b>Skype</b> provides video, voice and text chat.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.skype.com/go/download/">Download Skype</a> and install
it. Upon starting it, you'll be prompted to sign in or create a new account.</p>

<h3>Screenleap</h3>
<p><b>screenleap</b> provides screensharing through the web.</p>

<p>To use it, visit <a href="http://screenleap.com">screenleap.com</a> and
click "Share screen". This site requires that you have Java installed for your
browser, and you should be prompted to install it if you don't. </p>
