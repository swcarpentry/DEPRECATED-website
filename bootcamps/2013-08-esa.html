Ecological research projects and analyses are increasingly dependent on
programs of all sizes, many of them one-of-a-kind tools written by scientists
themselves. Unfortunately, most ecologists are never taught the equivalent of
good lab practices for software development, which means they are often less
productive than they could be, and their software is often less reliable than
it should be. 
</p>
<p>
Software Carpentry is a program designed to
train scientists to build and use computational tools more efficiently so they
can spend less time on the computer and more time doing science. Our day-long
workshop will introduce four specific tools &mdash; the Unix shell, version
control, automated testing, and regular expressions &mdash; that will help
ecologists in the era of big data, simulation, and increasingly complex
analyses. Each tool will facilitate ecological collaboration, research and data
management. 
</p>
<p>
The Unix shell is the standard interface for all computing
clusters and large database environments. Version control allows ecologists to
keep track of their code more efficiently, and will make collaboration easier
on large projects. A fundamental component to any kind of programming is making
sure your code does what you intended. Learning automated testing will
streamline this tedious process. Finally big data sets are not always what they
seem, and often require further clean-up. Regular expressions are a powerful
tool for the fuzzy searching of text to standardize variable names and inputs.
Attendees will leave our workshop with a suite of powerful tools that
streamline their research.
