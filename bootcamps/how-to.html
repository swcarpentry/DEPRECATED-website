<p>
  A boot camp is an intensive hands-on workshop
  in which participants learn software skills
  based on shorts tutorials and practical exercises.
  A typical boot camp runs over 2 days with 20-50 attendees,
  2-3 instructors,
  and one helper for every 10 attendees:
  This page documents our best practices
  for organising and running a bootcamp.
  We have divided advice according to
  the major roles involved in putting on a bootcamp:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="#organizer">Organisers</a>
    plan the logistics bootcamp (facilities, staff, transportation, food, etc).
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#instructor">Instructors</a> give the lectures,
    lead the practicals,
    and help the attendees during practical sessions.
    Our <a href="{{root_path}}/license.html">license</a>
    allows anyone who wants to use our materials to do so,
    but we maintain a <a href="{{root_path}}/badges/index.html#instructor-badge">list of badged instructors</a>,
    and are happy to help match instructors with sites that want boot camps.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#helper">Helpers</a> provide assistance during practical sessions.
    Helpers have often attended a boot camp themselves at some point,
    and are on the road to becoming instructors.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  We also have some advice on <a href="#mistake">what <em>not</em> to do</a>,
  which you may find useful as well.
</p>

<h3>We're Here To Help</h3>

<p>
  If you have any questions or would like help organising your boot camp,
  please email us at <a href="mailto:{{contact_email}}">{{contact_email}}</a>.
  We can:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>recruit instructors,</li>
  <li>advertise your bootcamp,</li>
  <li>handle registration,</li>
  <li>tell you what's worked (and hasn't) in the past,</li>
  <li>help you customize material for particular audiences,</li>
  <li>support requests for funding,</li>
</ul>

<p>
  and many other things as well&mdash;just ask.
  Please note,
  though,
  that as a condition of our support,
  we require boot camp organizers, instructors, and attendees to adhere to our
  <a href="{{root_path}}/bootcamps/conduct.html">code of conduct</a>.
</p>

<div id="organizer">

  <h2>For Organizers</h2>

  <p>
    As an organizer of a boot camp
    you are responsible for coordinating the entire event.
  <p>

  <h3>1. Decide what kind of boot camp you want</h3>

  <p>
    The first thing you need to decide is your intended audience.
    Can anyone apply or is it restricted to a specific university or company?
    Do you want to target people in a particular discipline
    (or range of related disciplines),
    or will your boot camp be open to all?
    You need to decide this early and then stick to it,
    because the type of boot camp you host will drive other decisions,
    from the topics covered and the room used
    to what follow-up sessions you offer (if any).
  </p>

  <p>
    A closed boot camp can be more easily tailored to a specific audience.
    In addition,
    the attendees are more likely to know one another,
    which in our experience means they're less inhibited about asking questions
    and more likely to help each other during practical sessions.
    On the other hand,
    it may be harder to find enough people to fill a boot camp if you restrict enrollment,
    and if your funding comes from the university or company level,
    it may be politically difficult to turn people away.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you choose a closed boot camp,
    beware that you may have to resist people trying to open it up once enrollment begins.
    If you have good reasons to keep it closed or invite-only,
    keep it that way.
  </p>

  <p>
    You also need to decide whether your boot camp is free or not.
    Boot camps traditionally have been free,
    but we are now frequently charging either a $20 deposit
    (refunded to everyone who attends both days),
    or a flat $20 fee,
    in order to reduce the no-show rate.
    We have found that both strategies reduce the number of no-shows from 20-25% to 5% or less,
    and in the case of a flat fee,
    the money can be used to cover coffee and snacks, local travel expenses, and so on.
    Be careful if you want to do this, though:
    as soon as you charge anything at all&mdash;even a refundable deposit&mdash;some
    venues will charge <em>you</em> for use of the space.
  </p>

  <p>
    While team signup is more difficult to manage than individual signup,
    it also has many benefits,
    including a lower no-show rate and more in-class peer support.
    And while we don't yet have any solid data to report,
    we believe it increases the likelihood of people using what they've learned
    after the boot camp is over:
    it's a lot easier for people to put what they've learned into practice
    if everyone in their lab is doing so at the same time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally,
    you should decide <em>before</em> the boot camp
    what kind of follow-up you're going to offer (if any).
    Some groups have run weekly lunch-and-learn sessions for a couple of months after a boot camp
    to help people put what they've learned into action.
    Other groups have set up mailing lists,
    and we've tried running online tutorials as well
    (though with disappointing results).
    Whatever you decide to do,
    figure it out in advance so that you can tell learners about it at least a couple of times.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Secure funding</h3>

  <p>
    Our instructors are volunteers,
    and do not need to be paid for their time,
    but boot camp hosts are expected to cover their travel and accommodation costs.
    (As far as possible,
    we try to match instructors to nearby sites in order to reduce these.)
    Some possible sources of funding are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      "Miscellaneous" funds
      (e.g., a couple of thousand dollars in a faculty member's grant).
      This is by far the most common case.
    </li>
    <li>
      Training budgets at the lab, department, or institutional level.
    </li>
    <li>
      Workshop budgets set aside as part of conferences.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It's much easier for us if instructors deal directly with host sites for reimbursement,
    but in complicated cases
    (e.g., several people traveling to do several boot camps,
    with costs shared between several sites),
    we can act as an intermediary.
  </p>

  <p><em>
      Note: A couple of people have contacted us
      to ask about running Software Carpentry boot camps commercially.
      Our material is all Creative Commons licensed,

      We're happy to give that permission if we've certified the instructor
      and have a chance to double-check the content
      (because we've already had one instance of people calling something "Software Carpentry"
      when it had nothing to do with what we usually teach.
      We've worked hard to create material that actually helps scientists,
      and to build some name recognition around it;
      we'd like to make sure our name continues to mean something.).

      please <a href="mailto:{{contact_email}}">get in touch</a>.
    </em></p>

  <h3>3. Recruit your instructors</h3>

  <p>
    You will need at least two instructors (and three works better):
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      It's too much to ask a single person to talk for eight hours a day for two days.
    </li>
    <li>
      Attendees will be more engaged if they hear from more than one person.
    </li>
    <li>
      Things can always go wrong at the last moment,
      so having two or three instructors reduces the risk of having to cancel
      because of illness,
      travel mishaps,
      etc.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It's critical that you recruit your instructors <em>before</em> you advertise your boot camp.
    Ideally,
    at least one should have co-taught with someone else before leading your boot camp,
    and the other instructors should have co-taught or been helpers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Encourage instructors to do a dry-run before the boot camp
    to check that everything they plan to teach is working.
    This is especially important if they'll be coding live,
    which is our recommended teaching style,
    or if it is their first time teaching:
    <em>everyone</em> over-estimates how much they'll be able to cover
    the first time they present,
    and a dry run helps reduce this problem.
  </p>

  <p>
    Offer your instructors help with travel and accommodation arrangements.
    If there is someone at your institution who regularly handles these kinds of things,
    connect them with instructors as soon as possible.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Choose your dates</h3>

  <p>
    Many factors determine when to hold your boot camp.
    The first is obviously the availability of instructors:
    we often use <a href="http://doodle.com">Doodle</a> to converge on dates that work for everyone,
    and are happy to set this up.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you hold the boot camp at a university,
    keep in mind that the start of term works better the end of term
    (when people are tired, and busy with final assignments and exams),
    and that the start of the second (or subsequent) term works better for graduate students
    than the start of first term
    (the start of an academic year is busy anyway,
    and by their second term most students have a better idea of their research problem's programming needs).
    In our experience mid-term breaks and reading weeks have <em>not</em> worked well:
    boot camps held then usually have high no-show rates.
  </p>

  <p>
    You could also schedule a boot camp immediately before or after a conference
    (or run it as a tutorial within a conference)
    to target people from a specific discipline.
    If you do this,
    involve the conference organizers early and often.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Book a room</h3>

  <p>
    You'll need a room with:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Front-facing tables</strong>
      so that attendees can watch an instructor and use their laptop at the same time.
      (Typing on a laptop for two days in theater-style seating can cause back strain.)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>High-speed WiFi or network access</strong>
      that can withstand everyone using it at the same time.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Power outlets</strong>
      for all the computers.
      This often involves extension cords;
      if you're doing that,
      make sure they're taped down.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Space for mingling</strong>
      without squeezing between chairs and tripping over cables.
      This is <em>essential</em>:
      if helpers cannot reach learners who are having problems quickly and easily,
      those learners will fall further and further behind as the day goes on.
      Again,
      theater-style lecture rooms are not recommended
      as their banked floors and fixed seating makes it very difficult for helpers to mingle.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>A microphone</strong>
      if the room is large or has poor acoustics,
      or if you are recording the lesson.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Disabled access.</strong>
      (Make sure the washrooms are accessible as well...)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Air-conditioning,</strong>
      because all those computers (and attendees) will generate a lot of heat.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The boot camp will run more smoothly if you have two projectors
    so that interactive demos can be shown alongside supporting slides,
    and also space for food and drink so that everyone can snack as they're working.
    Rooms usually aren't set up for the first,
    though,
    and there are often rules against the second.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Create your timetable</h3>

  <p>
    Start by checking out <a href="{root_path}}/bootcamps/index.html#past">previous boot camps</a>
    for ideas on what to cover.
    Remember,
    our <a href="{{root_path}}/license.html">license</a> lets you use and re-mix materials freely,
    provided you cite us as the original source.
    (We would also appreciate a chance to look at any improvements or additions you make
    so that we can update our own copies&mdash;please send us <a href="mailto:{{contact_email}}">email</a>
    or a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">pull request</a>.)
  </p>

  <p>
    For example,
    your schedule might look like this:
  </p>

  <table class="table table-striped">
    <tr>
      <td colspan="2">Day 1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>8:30 - 9:00</td>
      <td>Setup Help</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>9:00 - 10:30</td>
      <td>The Shell</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>10:30 - 12:00</td>
      <td>Python Variables</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>12:00 - 1:00</td>
      <td>Lunch</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>1:00 - 2:00</td>
      <td>Python Data Structures</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2:00 - 3:00</td>
      <td>Python Control Flow</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3:00 - 4:30</td>
      <td>Python Functions and Modules</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="2">Day 2</td>
    </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>9:00 - 10:30</td>
        <td>Version Control (Local Operations)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>10:30 - 12:00</td>
        <td>Version Control (Collaborating)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>12:00 - 1:00</td>
        <td>Lunch</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1:00 - 2:30</td>
        <td>Debugging</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2:30 - 3:30</td>
        <td>Testing</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3:30 - 4:30</td>
        <td>Documentation</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    In almost all cases,
    learners want to use their own laptops during boot camps
    so that they leave with a working environment set up.
    Even if you ask attendees to prepare beforehand,
    and give them detailed instructions,
    some will not and some won't be able to.
    You should therefore schedule time for <em>checking the learners' machines</em>
    at the beginning of the first day
    to save you from repeating the same thing individually to each attendee.
  </p>

  <p>
    Decide when you'll <em>start and end</em> each day,
    <em>what you'll cover</em>,
    and when <em>breaks and lunch</em> will be.
    A later start on the first day
    (e.g., 09:30 instead of 09:00)
    gives people who don't live nearby a better chance of being there for the start.
    Similarly,
    an earlier end (e.g., 16:30 instead of 17:00) allows non-locals time to travel home.
    Some attendees may also have child-care needs;
    it's worth asking about this by email before the boot camp starts
    so that people can respond one-to-one if they want to.
  </p>

  <h3>7. Recruit your helpers</h3>

  <p>
    Most of our helpers are scientists who have either gone through a previous boot camp,
    or learned most of what we teach on our own.
    You can usually recruit them locally from your own and nearby institutions,
    and should have at least one helper for every ten attendees.
    Most boot camps don't cover helpers' travel or accommodation expenses,
    but taking them out to dinner the day before the boot camp starts
    is a nice way to thank them
    (and gives them a chance to meet the instructors).
  </p>

  <h3>8. Set up registration</h3>

  <p>
    Find out if your institution or venue expects you to use their in-house registration system.
    If so, use it;
    if not,
    we recommend <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/">EventBrite</a>,
    and we are happy to host registrations on <a href="http://software-carpentry.eventbrite.com/">our account</a>.
    Either way,
    make sure you enable a waiting list,
    because boot camps are very popular.
  </p>

  <h3>9. Advertise</h3>

  <p>
    Create a web page with information about the boot camp:
    what it is,
    when it will be held,
    a link to the registration page,
    local travel information,
    and anything else you think attendees might need to know.
    It's best to keep this web page separate from the registration page
    so you have more control over both style and content.
  </p>

  <p>
    We can provide advice on how to advertise
    and are happy to publish your blog articles and tweets to our followers.
    We can also help to promote boot camps,
    either by advertising them or hosting your web page.
    If you are interested,
    please <a href="mailto:{{contact_email}}">email us</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you plan to photograph, record, or broadcast your boot camp
    then mention this on its web page.
    Your institution may require you to obtain a signed photo release
    from each person if pictures are being taken.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tweet and blog about the event and send emails to departmental mailing lists,
    discipline-specific mailing lists,
    specific people (e.g., lab directors or principal investigators),
    and anyone else who you think will be interested.
    Remember to include links to the advertising web page and the registration page.
    A sample page is shown below.
  </p>

  <blockquote>

    <p>
      <strong>When:</strong> May 14-15, 2013, 9.00 am to 5.00 pm.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Where:</strong> Room 99, Tesla Memorial Hall, Euphoric State University.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>What:</strong>
      Our goal is to help scientists and engineers become more productive by teaching them basic computing skills
      like program design, version control, testing, and task automation.
      Our teaching emphasises how these skills can contribute to quality, usable, reproducible research.
      In this two-day boot camp,
      short tutorials will alternate with hands-on practical exercises.
      Attendees will be encouraged both to help one another,
      and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems during and between sessions.
      There will be online follow up sessions for six to eight weeks extending the material from the boot camp.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Who:</strong>
      The course is aimed at postgraduate students and other scientists
      who are familiar with basic programming concepts (like loops, conditionals, arrays, and functions)
      but need help to translate this knowledge into practical tools to help them work more productively.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Requirements:</strong>
      Attendees must bring a laptop with a few specific software packages installed.
      The list will be sent to attendees a week before the boot camp.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Content:</strong> The syllabus for this boot camp will include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Using the shell to do more in less time.</li>
      <li>Using version control to manage and share information.</li>
      <li>Basic Python programming.</li>
      <li>How (and how much) to test programs.</li>
      <li>Working with relational databases.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>Registration:</strong>
      Please use the form below to register by April 6.
      We will allocate places to individuals and groups we believe will benefit,
      while aiming for a balance of subjects and geographical areas.
      We strongly encourage learners to attend with colleagues,
      so please create or join a team when you sign up.
      Ideally we would like teams of 3 to 6 members,
      and we will give preference to teams including one more knowledgeable member
      who is interested in organizing further training at their own institution.
    </p>

    <p>
      We will notify all applicants as to whether they have a spot no later than April 13.
      Note that a $20 deposit is required to register.
      This will be refunded to everyone who attends both days of the workshop.
    </p>

    </p>

  </blockquote>

  <h3>10. Arrange catering</h3>

  <p>
    If you can afford to provide coffee and snacks for attendees, do so:
    it cuts the time per coffee break to 10-15 minutes from 20-25 minutes.
    If you cannot do this,
    make sure that there is somewhere nearby where attendees can purchase refreshments,
    and schedule time accordingly.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are providing snacks,
    try to allow for allergies and other dietary restrictions.
    Please also make sure attendees have been told
    whether they can bring drinks and snacks into the room being used for the class.
  </p>

  <h3>11. Set up mailing lists</h3>

  <p>
    Set up a mailing list for organizers, lecturers, and helpers
    as soon as your boot camp is confirmed
    so that you can inform everyone about the latest news,
    organize who's teaching what,
    etc.
    You may also set up a mailing list for attendees,
    but we have found it's easier to use the registration system
    to broadcast information as needed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Make sure to have people sign in on both days
    (particularly if you have required a refundable deposit),
    and forward this list to us if possible
    so that we can invite people to join our announcements list,
    contact them about follow-up interviews six months or a year later,
    etc.
  </p>

  <h3>12. Publish your materials</h3>

  <p>
    Make your materials available to both the helpers and the attendees.
    publishing your slides, code, and scripts to the helpers in advance
    Having access to these materials
    allows learners to catch up in their own time if they fall behind,
    and lets helpers fill in gaps in their own understanding before the boot camp starts.
    The easiest way to do this is to clone our
    <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/boot-camps">boot camp repository</a>
    on GitHub.
  </p>

  <h3>13. Publish attendee setup information</h3>

  <p>
    Publish the list of software you expect attendees to have installed <em>before</em> they arrive.
    Our <a href="{{root_path}}/setup/index.html">setup pages</a>
    describe the software we usually use.
  </p>

  <p>
    You should also provide installation instructions for any software specific to your boot camp.
    Make sure you test your instructions on standard operating systems
    on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
    before you make them public.
  </p>

  <p>
    Add a link from your advertising web page to your setup instructions.
    Be clear that attendees are expected to set up their computers <em>before</em> arriving at the boot camp,
    and that they should email you if they have problems.
    (And by "before",
    we mean over a week before,
    not the day before or the evening before&mdash;this will save time on the day.)
    If your attendees are all local then you may want to consider having a drop-in setup clinic
    a day or two before your boot camp.
  </p>

  <h3>14. Select attendees</h3>

  <p>
    If you are using something other than first-come/first-served registration,
    select the attendees you want to attend and let them know they have a seat.
    Ask them to tell you as soon as possible if they can't make the boot camp,
    so that you can offer their place to someone else.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once registration is complete,
    email attendees to have them set up their computers as described above.
    Email people who didn't make it into your selection
    to let them know that they'll be held on a on a waiting list just in case an attendee drops out.
  </p>

  <h3>15. Send out a pre-camp questionnaire</h3>

  <p>
    You may want to send out a questionnaire prior to the boot camp
    to assess the expertise and interest of the attendees,
    where they come from,
    what their research areas are,
    and what operating systems they'll be using.
    This allows you to customise what you present,
    and how you present it.
    We are currently (March 2013) preparing templates to use for both purposes;
    please <a href="mailto:{{contact_email}}">email us</a> for details.
  </p>

  <h3>16. Gather your gear</h3>

  <p>
    Collect the equipment listed in the checklist
    at least a day before the start of the boot camp.
  </p>

  <h3>Checklists</h3>

  <p>
    Please track your preparations against the checklists below,
    and <a href="mailto:{{contact_email}}">let us know</a>
    if we should add anything
    to help future organizers.

<div id="instructor">

  <h2>For Instructors</h2>

  <p>
    Your job is to give lectures and lead practical exercises.
    You should also mingle with the attendees during practical sessions,
    but remember to give your voice a rest as well:
    your helpers are there to help.
  </p>

  <p>
    It <em>isn't</em> necessary for every instructor to know all of the material,
    but it helps,
    particularly if someone can't make it at the last minute.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally,
    remember that no lesson plan survives contact with the audience.
    We try to keep boot camps small so that instructors can respond to learners' questions
    puzzled looks,
    and/or signs of impatience.
  </p>

  <div class="well">
    <h3>Before</h3>
    <ul class="checklist">
      <li>
	Arrange travel to the boot camp site,
	accommodation,
	and transportation from wherever you're staying to wherever you're teaching.
	Save your receipts!
      </li>
      <li>
	Prepare your materials:
	<ul>
          <li>data sets</li>
          <li>cheat sheets</li>
          <li>exercises</li>
          <li>repositories</li>
          <li>Etherpad.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	Do a practice run of your tutorials and practicals,
	especially if you'll be coding live
	(our recommended teaching approach).
      </li>
      <li>
	Ensure you have the same setup as the attendees by working through your own setup pages.
      </li>
      <li>
	Post your practical exercises on web pages to allow students to refer to them during the boot camp.
	Data files or other useful information should also be added.
      </li>
      <li>
	Familiarise yourself with the material your fellow instructors will be presenting,
	just in case one of them pulls out.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>
    Note:
    Etherpad is a real-time collaborative text editor.
    We have found it helpful for taking notes and sharing code snippets during lessons.
    If you choose to use it,
    stick to a sensible naming convention
    (e.g., <code>bootcampname-date-lesson</code>)
    so we can track down Etherpads later.
    Alternatively,
    create an account on
    <a href="http://etherpad.mozilla.org">etherpad.mozilla.org</a>
    to automatically track the pads you create.
  </p>

  <div class="well">
    <h3>On the day</h3>
    <ul class="checklist">
      <li>
	If you are using multiple windows (e.g., a command window and an editor window)
	make sure they are both large enough to be visible by all attendees.
	Remember to pause when switching from one window to the other
	so that learners don't become confused.
	If possible,
	use different background colors for different text windows
	to make it easier for learners to tell them apart
	(but keep in mind red-green and blue-yellow color blindness).
      </li>
      <li>
	As you type at the command line,
	read out what you're typing.
	Remember that most learners can only go half as fast as you,
	because they have to watch you type,
	then type it all in again themselves.
      </li>
      <li>
	If possible,
	use <a href="http://etherpad.org">Etherpad</a> or something similar
	to share code snippets with learners.
	We can help you set this up if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
	Back up the material with your own anecdotes, experiences and evidence&mdash;it
	makes you more credible,
	helps learners understand how to apply what you're teaching to their own problems,
	and prevents the lectures from becoming too dry.
      </li>
      <li>
	Emphasise that good software development skills contribute to productive, reproducible, reusable research.
      </li>
      <li>
	For every question with a binary answer (yes/no, have done/have not done, works/does not work),
	ask learners to hold up green (yes) or red (no) sticky notes
	so that you can gauge their level of understanding.
	This also keeps them more engaged.
      </li>
      <li>
	When you ask attendees to do a practical exercise,
	have them post a red note on their laptop if they run into trouble
	and a green one when they have a solution.
	This lets you gauge how learners are progressing,
	and lets helpers see who needs their assistance.
      </li>
      <li>
	Just before each break,
	have learners write down one good point on their green sticky
	and one bad one on their red sticky
	and hand them in.
	It only takes a couple of minutes to sort through these,
	and it quickly tells you whether you're going too fast or too slow,
	whether you need to review some material after the break,
	etc.
	If you can,
	put each batch of sticky notes into an envelope
	and send them to us
	so that we can look for patterns.
      </li>
      <li>
	If people would rather not write on sticky notes,
	ask each person in the room to give you one good point or one bad one
	at the end of the final day
	(without repeating anything someone else has already said).
	Again,
	please send us this feedback so that we can look for patterns.

  <h2>For Helpers</h2>

  <p>
    As a helper, your job is to help the attendees during practical sessions.

      <li>
	If you have time,
	try and work through the setup information for the boot camp before you come along.
	Many of the questions you will get on the first day
	will be related to installation issues.

	They may be holding up a red sticky note,

      <li>
	If you can't answer an attendee's question, tell them that and ask an instructor for help.

  <h2>What <em>Not</em> To Do</h2>

  <p>
    No discussion of how to teach a boot camp would be complete without some discussion of what <em>not</em> to do.
    To that end, here are a few common mistakes.
  </p>

  <h3>Bore them.</h3>

  <p>
    Your audience will never care more about what you're teaching than you appear to,
    so if they get the feeling you're not interested in it,
    they won't be either.
    This does <em>not</em> mean you have to shout,
    crack three jokes a minute,
    or harangue them about how this stuff is really, really important,
    but you do owe it to your audience to show up mentally as well as physically.
  </p>

  <h3>Ignore them.</h3>

  <p>
    You're not there to reproduce one of our online videos in person:
    you're there to interact with people so that they get a better learning experience.
    You shouldn't ever go more than two or three minutes without asking a question (and listening to the answer),
    and if it has been 15 minutes since any of your learners asked one,
    odds are you've either lost them or are boring them.
  </p>

  <h3>Let them ignore each other.</h3>

  <p>
    Done right,
    Software Carpentry boot camps are a great networking opportunity for our learners (and for us, too).
    If you don't know half your learners by name at the end of two days,
    you're doing it wrong;
    if they haven't each made at least half a dozen new contacts,
    that's your fault too.
    Have them work in pairs, and require them to mix up the pairs at least a couple of times.
    Equally, encourage them to chat to one another at coffee breaks and lunch,
    and to get a pizza or some curry together for dinner on the first day.
  </p>

  <h3>All talk, no action.</h3>

  <p>
    The more time folks spend with their hands on the keyboards doing exercises,
    the more time they're actually paying attention.
    The students have their computers in front of them:
    if you talk for more than five minutes without asking them to use their computers, they'll do so anyway&mdash;on Facebook.
  </p>

  <h3>Use magic.</h3>

  <p>
    Typing too fast, using shortcuts or commands they haven't seen yet&mdash;basically,
    any time you say, "Don't worry about this just now,"
    or they say, "Wait, how did you do that?" or, "Can you please slow down, I can't keep up,"
    you're no longer actually helping them.
  </p>

  <h3>Don't close the loop.</h3>

  <p>
    You can't optimize without feedback, so:
  </p>

  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>
      Give them all red and green sticky notes so that they can put up a green one when they're finished an exercise,
      and a red one when they have a question or need setup help.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have them write down good and bad points before each break
      so that you can tell right away what you're doing right and wrong.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure to leave at least 20 minutes at the end of the final day for feedback
      (whether it's a verbal "one good/one bad" report,
      filling in an online survey,
      or whatever else you're using).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    And remember: feedback is pointless if you don't pay attention to it (or worse, if you explain it away).
    There's no point collecting feedback after each boot camp if you don't change what and how you teach to reflect it.
  </p>

  <h3>Don't master the material yourself.</h3>

  <p>
    It's OK to make mistakes and not know things&mdash;in fact,
    stumbling in front of your learners and then picking yourself up is a great teaching opportunity.
    But if they believe you don't have a solid grasp of the concepts underlying the material you're teaching,
    they will have less confidence in everything you say, even when you're right.
  </p>

  <h3>Don't tell them "why".</h3>

  <p>
    Most of our learners are graduate students in science and engineering,
    so they know what evidence looks like, and why working practices should be evidence-based.
    That doesn't mean you have to have the whole of empirical software engineering at your fingertips in order to teach,
    but please do read
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Facts-Fallacies-Software-Engineering-Robert/dp/0321117425/"><cite>Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering</cite></a>
    and sprinkle a few of the findings it quotes into your lessons.
  </p>

  <h3>Show them the forest but not the trees.</h3>

  <p>
    The things we teach reinforce each other,
    so tie them together at every opportunity.
    Point out that connecting things with pipes in the shell is like chaining functions together,
    or that they can use a shell script to re-run a bunch of different tests before committing to version control,
    and so on.
    If possible, take 15 minutes or so each day to show them how you use these tools in your day-to-day work.
  </p>

  <h3>Underestimate setup time.</h3>

  <p>
    Something always fails to install for someone,
    or a bunch of learners are accidentally locked out of the building after lunch,
    or whoever was supposed to drop off power bars didn't.
    Roll with it, and remember to laugh (even if it's a bit hysterically).
  </p>

  <h3>Underestimate setup requirements.</h3>

  <p>
    Do you have enough power outlets?  (Are you sure?)
    Do you have enough bandwidth to handle fifty people hitting your version control repository at the same time?  (How do you know?)
    Can everyone actually log in?
    And while we're here, does campus security know you're using the room over the weekend?
