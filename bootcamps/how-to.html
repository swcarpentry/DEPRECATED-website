<p><em>A boot camp is an intensive hands-on workshop during which participants
learn software skills based on shorts tutorials and practical exercises.</em> A
typical boot camp runs over 2 days with 20-50 attendees, 2-3 instructors, and at
least one helper for every 10 attendees.</p>

The following page documents our best practices for organising and running a
bootcamp.  We've divided up this guide by the major roles involved in putting on
a bootcamp: 
<ul>
  <li><a href="#organizer">Organisers</a> plan the logistics bootcamp (facilities,
  staff, transportation, food, etc).</li>

  <li><a href="#instructor">Instructors</a> give the lectures, and lead and help
  the practical sessions.</li>

  <li><a href="#helper">Helpers</a> assist instructors, typically by
  offering one-on-one assistance to bootcamp participants.</li>
</ul>

<!--TODO explain the role of SWC in putting on bootcamps, or assisting others in
putting on bootcamps-->

  <h2>For Organizers</h2>
  <p>As an organizer of a bootcamp you are responsible for coordinating the entire
  event. <p>

  </ol></p>

  <h3 id="initial-planning">Initial planning (at least two months out)</h3>
  <p>This is stage in which you will finalize important decisions that will
  drive many of your other decisions: from the topics covered, to the room used,
  to how you plan any follow-up sessions.</p>

  <ol>
  <li><h4>Decide whether the boot camp is open or closed?</h4>
    <p>That is, can anyone apply or is it restricted to a specific university or
    company?</p>

    <p>Considerations: A <em>closed bootcamp</em> can be more easily
    tailored to a specific audience, the attendees are more likely to know one
    another and follow-ups will be easier. Beware that boot camps are so popular
    you will have to continuously resist people who will try to persuade you to
    open it up.  If you've got good reasons to keep it closed or invite-only, keep
    it that way.</p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Decide whether the boot camp is free?</h4>
    <p>Decide whether the boot camp will be free, require a deposit (repaid if
    attendee is at the boot camp for both days) or have a small fee.</p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Find/apply for funding</h4>
    <p>Funding will allow you to pay for instructors' travel and lodging
    expenses (if necessary), food, and equipment.</p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Recruit instructors</h4>
    <p><em>You need at least two or three instructors for a two-day
    bootcamp.</em> (It's too much to ask a single person to talk for eight hours
    a day for two days, and attendees will be more engaged if they hear from
    more than one person.) Ideally, at least one will already have co-taught a
    boot camp with someone else, and the others will either have taught or
    helped out.</p>

    <p>It's critical that you recruit your instructors <em>before</em> you
    advertise your boot camp. Ensure that you have back-up instructors who can
    take over if the original instructor has to pull out.</p>

    <p>Offer your instructors help in travel and finding accomodation. Ideally,
    you should offer to reimburse them their travel and accomodation expenses as
    this is how we help sustain Software Carpentry.</p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Choose your dates</h4>
  <p>Considerations:
    <ul>
      <li><em>The availability of instructors.</em> This is likely your primary
      constraint.</li>

      <li><em>Academic term.</em> If you hold the boot camp at a university,
      keep in mind that the start of term works better than end of term (when
      exams are held), and that the start of second (or subsequent) term works
      better for graduate students than the start of first term (the start of an
      academic year is already busy).
      <p>In our experience mid-term breaks and reading weeks have not worked
      well&mdash;they have had high no-show rates.</p></li>

      <li><em>Proximity to events.</em> You might also consider scheduling a boot camp
      immediately before or after a conference.  Not only will this give you a
      large audience, but it will also make the boot camp easier to run, because
      it's easier to teach attendees who are all from the same community.</li>
    </ul></p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Book a room</h4>
    <p>You'll need to find a room with:
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Front-facing tables</strong> so that attendees can watch an
    instructor and use their laptop at the same time.</li>

    <li><strong>Space for mingling</strong> without tripping over cables and
    squeezing between chairs. Lecture theatres are not recommended as their
    banked floors and fixed seating makes it very difficult for helpers to
    mingle.</li>

    <li> <strong>High-speed wi-fi or network access</strong> that can
    withstand everyone using it at the same time. </li>

    <li><strong>Power</strong> for all the computers.</li>

    <li><strong>A microphone</strong> if the room's very big or has poor
    acoustics.</li>

    <li><strong>Disabled access.</strong></li>

    <li><strong>Air-conditioning,</strong> because all those computers (and
    attendees) will generate a lot of heat.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p> The boot camp will run even more smoothly if you have two projectors so
    that interactive demos can be shown alongside supporting slides, and also
    space for food and drink so that everyone can snack as they're working.</p>
  </li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="two-months">Two months before</h3>
  <ol>
  <li><h4>Create your timetable</h4>
    <p> To start, check out <a href="index.html#past">previous boot camps</a>
    for ideas on what lectures to cover.  (All Software Carpentry materials are
    freely available under a Creative Commons licence, so you are free to re-use
    and re-mix the materials.) </p>

    <p> You can include time for a <em>checking your environment</em> session at
    the start of each practical, so that the attendees' environments and
    tool-sets are all checked and fixed as a group. This saves you from
    repeating the same thing individually to each attendee.  Even if you ask
    attendees to prepare their environment before the boot camp, you will find
    that some have not and some cannot.  </p>

    <p> Decide when you'll start and end each day, what you'll cover, and when
    breaks and lunch will be. A later start on the first day (e.g., 09:30
    instead of 09:00) gives a bit of extra time to travel for anyone who doesn't
    live nearby. Similarly, an earlier end (e.g., 16:30 instead of 17:00) allows
    non-locals time to travel home. Attendees may have child-care needs so bear
    this in mind.</p>

    <p>For example, your time table might look like this: 
      <div class="row-fluid">
        <div class="span4 offset2">
          <strong>Day 1</strong>

  <li><h4>Recruit helpers</h4>
    <p> You'll need at least one helper for every ten attendees, and it's ideal
    to have one helper for every five attendees. Recruit helpers locally, from
    your own and neighbouring institutions.</p>

    <p>Offer your helpers help in travel and finding accomodation, if they need
    it.</p>

    <p> Helpers should have some knowledge of the material covered in the boot
    camp. Ideally, a helper will already have attended a boot camp and would
    like to become an instructor themselves.</p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Set up registration</h4>

    <p>
      Find out if your institution or venue expects you to use their in-house registration system.
      If so, use it!
      If not,
      then we recommend <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/">EventBrite</a>,
      and Software Carpentry are happy to host registrations on their <a href="http://software-carpentry.eventbrite.com/">EventBrite</a> site.
      Make sure you enable a waiting list, because boot camps are very popular.
    </p>

    <p>
      Boot camps have traditionally been free,
      but we are now experimenting with a small registration fee (e.g., $20) to reduce the no-show rate.
      (The money we raise is used to cover pizza, coffee, local travel expenses, and so on.)
      Be careful if you want to do this:
      as soon as you're charging anything at all,
      some venues will charge <em>you</em> for use of the space.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Advertise</h4>
    <p> Create a web page with information about the boot camp: what it is, when
    it will be held, a link to the registration page, and local travel
    information.  It's best to keep this web page separate from the registration
    page so you have more control over both style and content.  </p>

    <p> We can provide advice on how to advertise and are happy to publish your
    blog articles and tweets to our followers.  We can also help to promote boot
    camps, either by advertising them or hosting your web page.  If you are
    interested then please contact us by email at <a
    href="mailto:{{contact_email}}">{{contact_email}}</a>.  </p>

    <p> If you plan to photograph, record, or broadcast your boot camp then
    mention this on the web page.  A signed photo release may be required from
    each person if pictures are being taken.  </p>

    <p>Tweet and blog about the event and send emails to departmental mailing
    lists, disciplinary mailing lists, specific people (e.g., lab directors or
    principal investigators), and anyone else who you think will be interested.
    Remember to include links to the advertising web page and the registration
    page as shown below: </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>When:</strong> May 14-15, 2013, 9.00 am to 5.00 pm.</p>

      <p><strong>Where:</strong> Room 99, Tesla Memorial Hall, Euphoric State
      University.</p>

      <p><strong>What:</strong> Our goal is to help scientists and engineers
      become more productive by teaching them basic computing skills, like program
      design, version control, testing, and task automation. In our teaching we
      emphasise how these skills can contribute to quality, usable, reproducible
      research. In this two-day boot camp, short tutorials will alternate with
      hands-on practical exercises. Attendees will be encouraged both to help one
      another, and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems
      during and between sessions. There will be online follow up sessions for six
      to eight weeks extending the material from the boot camp.</p>

      <p><strong>Who:</strong> The course is aimed at postgraduate students and
      other scientists who are familiar with basic programming concepts (like
      loops, conditionals, arrays, and functions) but need help to translate this
      knowledge into practical tools to help them work more productively.</p>

      <p><strong>Requirements:</strong> Attendees must bring a laptop with a few
      specific software packages installed. (The list will be sent to attendees a
      week before the boot camp.)</p>

      <p><strong>Content:</strong> The syllabus for this boot camp will
      include:</p>

      <ul> <li>Using the shell to do more in less time.</li> <li>Using version
      control to manage and share information.</li> <li>Basic Python
      programming.</li> <li>How (and how much) to test programs.</li> <li>Working
      with relational databases.</li> </ul>

      <p><strong>Registration:</strong> Please use this form to register your
      interest by April 6. We will allocate places to individuals and groups we
      believe will benefit, while aiming for a balance of subjects and
      geographical areas. We strongly encourage learners to attend with
      colleagues, so please create or join a team when you sign up. Ideally we
      would like teams of 3 to 6 members, and we will give preference to teams
      including one more knowledgeable member who is interested in organizing
      further training at their own institution.</p>

      <p>There is no charge to attend, however, by registering you are stating
      that you will attend both days of the boot camp and participate in the
      online exercises and follow-up sessions in the following weeks.</p>

      <p>We will notify all applicants as to whether they have a spot no later
      than April 13.</p>

      <p><strong>Contact:</strong> For further information please email us at
      <u>software-carpentry@euphoric.edu</u>.</p>

    </blockquote>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Arrange catering</h4>
    <p> It's great to provide coffee or snacks at breaks if you can get someone
    to pay for them.  If not, make sure that there is somewhere nearby where
    attendees can purchase refreshments and schedule for this.  </p>

    <p> If you are providing snacks, remember to allow for allergies and other
    dietary restrictions.  </p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Set up an email list</h4>
    <p> Set up an email list so that you can inform everyone about the latest
    news and address any queries.  You'll find this useful for organising online
    follow-ups after the boot camp too.  </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="two-weeks">Two weeks before</h3>
<ol>
  <li><h4>Publish your materials</h4>
    <p> Make all your materials available to both the helpers and the attendees.
    Publishing your slides, code, and scripts to the helpers in advance allows
    them to know what's coming and to be able to help more effectively.  For
    attendees, having access to the materials allows them to catch up in their
    own time if they fall behind.  (The easiest option is usually to clone one
    of the Software Carpentry repositories on GitHub.) </p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Publish attendee setup information</h4>
    <p> Publish the list of software you expect attendees to have installed
    <em>before</em> they come to the boot camp.  </p>

    <p> Our <a href="{{root_path}}/setup">boot camp setup</a> pages lists the
    standard boot camp software and has instructions how to install it all for
    various operating systems.  </p>

    <p> You should also provide installation instructions for any software
    specific to your boot camp. Make sure you <em>test</em> your installation
    instructions on standard operating systems (Linux, Windows, Mac OS X) before
    you make them public.  </p>

    <p> Add a link from your advertising web page to the setup page.  Be clear
    that attendees are expected to set up their computers <em>before</em>
    arriving at the boot camp, and that they should email you if they have
    problems.  (And by "before", we mean over a week before, not the day before
    or the evening before&mdash;this will save time on the day.) </p>

    <p> If your attendees are all local then you may want to consider having a
    drop-in setup surgery a couple of days before your boot camp.  </p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Select attendees</h4>
    <p> Select the attendees you want to attend and inform them that they have a
    seat.  Ask them let you know as soon as possible if they can't make the boot
    camp, so that you can offer their place to someone else.  </p>

    <p> Add the selected attendees to your email list.  Email the attendees and
    get them set up their computers as described on your boot camp's setup page.
    </p>

    <p> Apologise to the people who didn't make it into your selection, and let
    them know that they'll be held on a on a waiting list just in case an
    attendee drops out.  </p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Send out a pre-camp questionnaire</h4>
    <p> You may want to consider sending out a questionnaire prior to the boot
    camp to assess the expertise and interest of the attendees, where they come
    from, what they're researching, and what operating system they'll be using.
    This allows you to customise what you present, how you present it, and the
    level at which you present it accordingly.  For examples, see our articles
    on <a
    href="{{root_path}}/blog/2012/11/pre-assessment.html">pre-assessment</a> and
    <a
    href="{{root_path}}/blog/2012/10/two-self-assessments.html">post-assessment</a>.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Encourage instructors to do a dry-run</h4>
    <p> Encourage instructors to do a dry-run before the boot camp to check that
    everything they have planned to teach is working.  This is especially
    important if they'll be presenting commands live at a command-prompt.</p>
  </li>

  <li><h4>Gather your gear</h4>
    <p>You will need the following gear for the boot camp,</p>

    <ul>
    <li>A projector (preferably two so that interactive demos can be shown
    alongside supporting slides).</li>
    <li>A MAC VGA adapter, for anyone who presents using a Mac.</li>
    <li>Extension leads so that everyone can have access to a socket.</li>
    <li>Two different colors of Post-It notes <a
    href="http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/2013/01/18/when-the-sticky-goes/">people
    can use to signal</a> when they have finished an exercise or when they have
    problems, to answer multiple-choice questions, etc.</li>
    <li>Guest wi-fi or network usernames and passwords for everyone.</li>
    <li>If possible, workstations with the required software just in case
        someone can't get access to the wi-fi or network.</li>
    <li>An attendance sheet so that you can see whether there are any no-shows.</li>
    <li>Photo release forms, if you intend to take photos.</li>
    <li>Garish badges for instructors and helpers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="well">
  <p>Congratulations! You are almost there. The days leading up to the boot camp
  can be very full.  We've organised the rest of the guide as a checklist to
  keep you on track:</p>

  <h3 id="one-week">One week before</h3>

  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>Request confirmation from attendees that they will be attending.</li>

    <li>Let the people on the waiting list know if they can attend or not.</li>

    <li>You may want to invite ten or so locals from the waiting list to turn
    up. If there are still empty seats at mid-morning on the first day, then
    they're welcome to stay. If not, they're welcome to come back for the next
    one, but make it clear <em>before </em>they arrive, that their participation
    is not guaranteed.</li>

    <li>Remind attendees of the setup page, and make it clear that they are
    expected to set up their computer <em>before</em> they attend the boot camp
    and to email the list if they have a problem.</li>

    <li>Send a pre-boot camp questionnaire, if you want to find any information
    out beforehand (e.g. their understanding of programming, languages they want
    to work with, their research backgrounds).</li>
    
    <li>Contact your instructors and ask them to make their material available
    and put any practical exercises on web pages so that attendees can refer to
    them during the boot camp. Data files or other useful information should
    also be added.</li>

    <li>Contact your helpers, see if they have any questions and ask them to
    arrive 10-15 minutes early so they can be briefed.</li>

    <li>Remind instructors and helpers to familiarise themselves with all the
    material (especially instructors, in case they end up covering for an
    instructor who has to pull out) and also to set up the boot camp software on
    their laptops too.</li>

    <li>Publish your materials online if you have not already done so.</li>

    <li>Identify a suitable pub or bar for socialising after the first day.</li>

    <li>Invite your instructors and helpers to go out for dinner.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="one-day">The day before</h3>

  <ul class="checklist">
    <li>Is the building and the room going to be unlocked on the day of the
    event?</li>
    <li>Is the room clearly signposted?</li>
    <li>Do you know where the toilets are?</li>
    <li>Is there any noisy construction/cleaning going on and, if so, can you do
    something about it?</li>
    <li>Is the projector working, and do you have a spare bulb?</li>
    <li>Do you have a MAC VGA adapter?</li>
    <li>Do you have enough extension cables?</li>

    <li>Have you set up all the accounts, web sites and repositories you will
    need?</li>
    <li>Do you have red and green sticky notes?</li>
    <li>Do you have badges for instructors and helpers?</li>
    <li>Print out the attendance sheets?</li>

  <h2>For Instructors</h2>

  <p>Your job is to give lectures and lead practicals.  You should also mingle
  with the attendees during practical sessions and provide assistance.  </p>

  <h3>Before</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Book transport to the boot camp location, and lodging.  (Save your
    recipts!)</li>

    <li>Prepare your sessions(s).</li>

    <li>Review Mike Jackson's <a
    href="http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2013-01-08-top-tips-instructors-software-carpentry-boot-camp">Top
    Tips for instructors</a></li>


    <li>Prepare the materials you'll need:
        <ul>
        <li>data sets</li>
        <li>cheat sheets</li>
        <li>exercises</li>
        <li>repositories</li>
        <li>etherpad notepads.  You can set up as many etherpad notepads as you
        like. Stick to a sensible naming convention (e.g.,
        <code>bootcampname-date-lesson</code>) so we can track down the
        etherpads later. Or create an account on <a
        href="http://etherpad.mozilla.org">etherpad.mozilla.org</a> to
        automatically track the pads you create. </li>
        <li>..</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li> Do a practice run of your tutorials and practicals, especially if
    you'll be presenting commands live at a command-prompt.</li>

    <li>Ensure you have the same setup as the attendees by working through the
    boot camp software set-up pages.</li>

    <li>Post your practical exercises on web pages to allow students to refer
    to them during the boot camp.  Data files or other useful information should
    also be added.</li>

    <li>Familiarise yourself with the material your fellow instructors will be
    presenting, just in case one of them pulls out.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>On the day</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>If you are using multiple windows (e.g., a command window and an editor
    window) then you'll need to ensure that they are both of sufficient size to
    be visible by all attendees, or pause before switching from one window to
    the other, because some attendees may get confused when you switch windows.
    </li>

    <li> Use different background colors for different shell windows, and
    encourage students to do the same.  This makes it easier to follow the
    window you are using (but keep in mind red-green and blue-yellow color
    blindness when choosing colors).</li>

    <li> As you type at the command-line, read out what you're typing.</li>

    <li> Back up the material with your own anecdotes, experiences and
    evidence&mdash;it prevents the lectures from being too dry.</li>

    <li> Emphasise the reasons why good software development skills contribute
    to good, reproducible, reusable research.</li>

    <li> For any question with a binary answer (yes/no, have done/have not done,
    works/does not work), ask your attendees to hold up their green (yes) or red
    (no) sticky notes so that you can gauge their level of understanding.</li>

    <li> When you've asked attendees to do something, get them to put a red
    sticky note prominently on their laptop and to replace it with a green one
    when they've succeeded/completed. This lets you gauge how the attendees are
    progressing.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>The day after</h3>
  <ol>
  <li>Send the organisers a list of what you think worked and what didn't, to
  help improve future boot camps.</li>
  </ol>

    <h2>What <em>Not</em> To Do</h2>

    <p>No discussion of how to teach a boot camp would be complete without some
    discussion of what <em>not</em> to do.  To that end, here are a few common
    mistakes.  </p>

    <h3>Bore them.</h3>
    <p> Your audience will never care more about what you're teaching than you
    appear to, so if they get the feeling you're not interested in it, they won't
    be either.  This does <em>not</em> mean you have to shout, crack three jokes a
    minute, or harangue them about how this stuff is really, really important, but
    you do owe it to your audience to show up mentally as well as physically.
    </p>

    <h3>Ignore them.</h3> <p> You're not there to reproduce one of our online
    videos in person: you're there to interact with people so that they get a
    better learning experience.  You shouldn't ever go more than two or three
    minutes without asking a question (and listening to the answer), and if it has
    been 15 minutes since any of your learners asked one, odds are you've either
    lost them or are boring them.  </p>

    <h3>Let them ignore each other.</h3>
    <p> Done right, Software Carpentry boot camps are a great networking
    opportunity for our learners (and for us, too).  If you don't know half your
    learners by name at the end of two days, you're doing it wrong; if they
    haven't each made at least half a dozen new contacts, that's your fault too.
    Have them work in pairs, and require them to mix up the pairs at least a
    couple of times.  Equally, encourage them to chat to one another at coffee
    breaks and lunch, and to get a pizza or some curry together for dinner on the
    first day.  </p>

    <h3>All talk, no action.</h3>
    <p> The more time folks spend with their hands on the keyboards doing
    exercises, the more time they're actually paying attention.  The students have
    their computers in front of them: if you talk for more than five minutes
    without asking them to use their computers, they'll do so anyway&mdash;on
    Facebook.  </p>

    <h3>Use magic.</h3>

    <p> Typing too fast, using shortcuts or commands they haven't seen
    yet&mdash;basically, any time you say, "Don't worry about this just now," or
    they say, "Wait, how did you do that?" or, "Can you please slow down, I can't
    keep up," you're no longer actually helping them.  </p>

    <h3>Don't close the loop.</h3>

    <p>You can't optimize without feedback, so:
    <ol>
      <li>Give them all red and green sticky notes so that they can put up a green
      one when they're finished an exercise, and a red one when they have a
      question or need setup help.</li>
      <li> Have them fill in "minute cards" before each break, i.e., write down in
      one sentence something they've learned or found useful, and something that
      confused them or didn't work for them, on the two sides of a small card, and
      hand that in.</li>
      <li> Make sure to leave at least 20 minutes at the end of the final day for
      feedback (whether it's a verbal "one good/one bad" report, or filling in an
      online survey, or whatever else you're using).</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <p>And remember: feedback is pointless if you don't pay attention to it (or
    worse, if you explain it away).  There's no point using minute cards if you
    don't bother to read them until the boot camp is over, and no point collecting
    feedback after each boot camp if you don't change what and how you teach to
    reflect it.</p>

    <h3>Don't master the material yourself.</h3>
    <p>It's OK to make mistakes and not know things&mdash;in fact, stumbling in
    front of your learners and then picking yourself up is a great teaching
    opportunity. But if they believe you don't have a solid grasp of the concepts
    underlying the material you're teaching, they will have less confidence in
    everything you say, even when you're right.</p>

    <h3>Don't tell them "why".</h3>
    <p>Most of our learners are graduate students in science and engineering, so
    they know what evidence looks like, and why working practices should be
    evidence-based. That doesn't mean you have to have the whole of empirical
    software engineering at your fingertips in order to teach, but please do read
    <a
    href="http://www.amazon.com/Facts-Fallacies-Software-Engineering-Robert/dp/0321117425/"><cite>Facts
    and Fallacies of Software Engineering</cite></a> and sprinkle a few of the
    findings it quotes into your lessons.</p>

    <h3>Show them the forest but not the trees.</h3>
    <p> The things we teach reinforce each other, so tie them together at every
    opportunity.  Point out that connecting things with pipes in the shell is like
    chaining functions together, or that they can use a shell script to re-run a
    bunch of different tests before committing to version control, and so on.  If
    possible, take 15 minutes or so each day to show them how you use these tools
    in your day-to-day work.</p>

    <h3>Underestimate setup time.</h3>
    <p> Something always fails to install for someone, or a bunch of learners are
    accidentally locked out of the building after lunch, or whoever was supposed
    to drop off power bars didn't.  Roll with it, and remember to laugh (even if
    it's a bit hysterically).</p>

    <h3>Underestimate setup requirements.</h3>
    <p> Do you have enough power outlets?  (Are you sure?) Do you have enough
    bandwidth to handle fifty people hitting your version control repository at
    the same time?  (How do you know?) Can everyone actually log in?  And while
    we're here, does campus security know you're using the room over the weekend?</p>

  <h2>For Helpers</h2>

  <p>As a helper, your job is to help the attendees during practical sessions.
  Helpers typically have attended a previous boot camp, or are familiar with the
  subject matter.</p>

  <h3>Before</h3>
  <ol class="checklist">
    <li> Ensure you're familiar with or have read over the material the
    instructors will cover in the sessions you're helping with.  </li>

    <li> If you have time, try and work through the setup information for the
    boot camp before you come along. Many of the questions you may get as a
    helper on the first day will be on installation/post-installation problems.
    </li>

    <li> Read the blog posts by <a
    href="{{root_path}}/blog/2012/10/how-to-help-at-a-boot-camp.html">Katy
    Huff</a> and <a
    href="http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2012-11-02-top-tips-helpers-software-carpentry-bootcamp">Aleksandra
    Pawlik</a> on how to be a helper.  </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>On the day</h3>
  <ol>
    <li> Go round the room and look for attendees who need help.  They may be
    holding up a red sticky note, but they may also just be sitting there
    looking despondent or peering intently at their laptop.  </li>

    <li> If you can't answer an attendee's question, just say so and grab an
    instructor. </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>The day after</h3>
  <ol>
    <li> Send the organisers a list of what you think worked and what didn't, to
    help improve future boot camps.  </li>
  </ol>
