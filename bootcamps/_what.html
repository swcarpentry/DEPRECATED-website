  <strong>What:</strong>
  Our goal is to help scientists and engineers become more productive by
  teaching them basic computing skills like program design, version control,
  testing, and task automation. In this two-day boot camp, short tutorials will
  alternate with hands-on practical exercises. Participants will be encouraged
  to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own
  research problems during and between sessions. After the boot camp, all
  participants are welcome to attend our online office hours where they can
  get one-on-one help from Software Carpentry instructors.
