  by teaching them basic computing skills. At the EGI Forum we will be
  hosting a day of boot camp "highlights". This consists of 3 standalone
  sessions which provide a short introduction to 3 valuable computing
  skills and that will also give attendees a flavour of what a full 
  boot camp is like.
