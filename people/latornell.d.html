  Latornell</a></span> is a professional engineer with a background of
  creating and using software to solve problems in a wide range of application
  areas. His post-graduate research was in the fields of experimental and
  computational fluid mechanics (M.Sc.), and modeling and control of robotic
  manipulators (Ph.D.).  By day he works for Nordion in Vancouver, where he
  helps to produce a variety of medical isotopes by proton irradiation from
  cyclotron accelerators.  Side projects include software engineering support
  for a coupled biology and physics model of deep estuaries, and an
  operational deployment of that model that, through the winter months,
  calculates a daily prediction of the date of the first spring phytoplankton
  bloom in the Strait of Georgia.</div>
