<p>This last Saturday and Sunday, Katy Huff and I (Anthony Scopatz) had the pleasure
of organizing a Software Carpentry workshop at the University of Chicago.  We had 77
people attend in total and by the end of the day on Sunday we remained 45+ strong.
(Frankly, who doesn't what to listen to me rant about documentation at 4 pm on a 
Sunday afternoon?!)  This weekend was unique in that we had a host of first time
instructors:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>John Blischak</li>
  <li>Radhika Khetani</li>
  <li>Patrick Fuller</li>
  <li>Jed Brown</li>
  <li>Will Trimble</li>
  <li>Sri Hari Krishna Narayanan</li>
</ul>

<p>Of note, John Blischak was an attendee if the April 2012 Bootcamp at the University 
of Chicago.  Additionally, Cait Pickens also showed up and did some extensive 
surveying of the students prior- and post-bootcamp.  So be on the watch for her
analysis when it becomes available.

<p><strong>Support & Thanks</strong></p>

<p>One thing that made running this bootcamp significantly different and easier than
all prior workshops I have been involved in was the generous institutional support
from the <a href="http://grad-affairs.uchicago.edu/">Graduate Student Affairs</a> 
office and Kalee Ludeks.  In addition to providing free lunches catered by 
<a href="http://www.zhmarketcafe.com/">Z&H</a> on both days, Kalee also helped us
reserve a room, contact departments and graduate students, create a flier, and
all of the other minutia that goes into organizing one of these events.  I can 
safely say that without their help, this boot camp would not have happened!  So 
if you get an opportunity, please take the time to thank them.  And, as always, 
thanks again to Greg Wilson and the Software Carpentry crowd for enabling this kind
of activity.
