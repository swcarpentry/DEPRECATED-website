<p>It's been over a week since our first boot camp for women in science and engineering wrapped up in Boston, and feedback has been coming in pretty steadily.  In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adina Chuang-Howe (one of the instructors) wrote a <a href="http://adina.github.io/2013/07/05/swc-wise-bootcamp---june-2013/">comprehensive summary</a> of what happened and what we learned from it.</li>
  <li>Aleksandra Pawlik (another instructor) <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2013-06-28-software-carpentry-bootcamp-women-science-and-engineering-boston">wrote about it</a> for the Software Sustainability Institute's blog.</li>
  <li>Sally Gore <a href="http://librarianhats.net/2013/06/25/coulda-shoulda-woulda/">posted</a> about the "coulda woulda shoulda" of learning to program.</li>
  <li>Kaitlin Thaney (the newly appointed director of the Mozilla Science Lab) <a href="http://kaythaney.com/2013/06/28/eating-our-own-dogfood-the-wise-bootcamp/">wrote</a> about us eating our own dog food&mdash;this was her first boot camp, and it's given her lots of ideas.</li>
  <li>Terri Yu wrote about <a href="{{root_path}}/blog/2013/06/after-wise.html">follow-on activities</a> right after the boot camp, then posted some <a href="http://terriyu.info/blog/posts/2013/06/swc-wise/">personal reflections</a> a few days later.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many thanks once again to everyone who worked so hard to pull it together, and to our sponsors for their support.  We look forward to doing it again soon.</p>
