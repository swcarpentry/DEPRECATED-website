    <a href="http://penandpants.com">Matt Davis</a> taught
    in "Room B" at the recent
    <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2013/03/washington-went-well.html">University of Washington boot camp</a>.
    It was a great group of very enthusiastic students! Thanks also to our very
    capable helpers <a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/">Jake Vanderplas</a> and
    David Leen!

 Here's our traditional good/bad feedback:

<table class="table table-striped">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Good</th>
<th>Bad</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Learning about Python and NumPy, especially the practice exercises.</td><td>Too much shell stuff (already shell proficient).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>We talked about best practice issues in software development.</td><td>Difficult to keep up with instructor when switching between screens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Great holistic crash course on Python and git. Did well with a range of expertise the room.</td><td>Too much typing while trying to listen.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Overall great intro to many great topics.</td><td>Would have preferred basic Python scripting instead of NumPy intro.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The one-on-one help and the exercises.</td><td>matplotlib and NumPy were a little dry.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pace was quick, almost too fast, but not quite!</td><td>The Python part was rushed and we didn't have time to see all of the code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Intuitive approach.</td><td>Command line tutorial was slow (but that was probably necessary for some).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Intro to IPython Notebook.</td><td>A bit too fast in some content.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Very well structured. Good collection of topics for introduction. Staff very responsive.</td><td>NumPy section could use more exercises/interaction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Very helpful and useful.</td><td>Wanted to learn about SciPy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The existence of Software Carpentry and the integrated exercises.</td><td>The software engineering felt too rushed -- if I made an error in my code I easily fell behind and was lost.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td><td>Wanted just Python.</td>
</tr>
