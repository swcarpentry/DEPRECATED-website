<p>Digital badges are a hot meme right now.  They let anyone, anywhere, issue credentials that are finer-grained than degree certificates or driver's licenses.  Want people to know that you can change the oil in a car?  There's a badge for that.  Or that you can speak conversational Frisian? There's a badge for that too. And <a href="http://openbadges.org/">"backpack" sites</a> make it easy to aggregate badges, including the ones that show you've <a href="{{root_path}}/badges/index.html#creator-badge">created content for Software Carpentry</a>, that you're <a href="{{root_path}}/badges/index.html#instructor-badge">qualified to teach it</a>, or that you've helped to <a href="{{root_path}}/badges/index.html#organizer-badge">organize and run a boot camp</a>.</p>
<p>In discussion with <a href="http://cameronneylon.net/">Cameron Neylon</a> earlier today, another use case for badges came up&mdash;one that will require a bit of tooling, but would be useful in a lot of contexts.  When I submit a paper to a scientific journal, the reviews that come back are usually anonymous (i.e., I don't know who the reviewers were).  There are good reasons for this, but it creates a problem: how do I know how to assess those reviews?  To borrow Cameron's example, if my physics paper gets one review from Richard Feynman and one from Joe the Mechanic, I probably ought to pay more attention to Feynman's&mdash;unless the paper is describing an experimental setup, in which case I should probably care more about Joe's, because Feynman was notoriously bad at doing experiments.</p>
<p>I can't solve this problem with badges right now because each badge identifies the person it was issued for (which is kind of the point).  But what if Jane, as a reviewer, could go back to the badge issue (or to the backpack site she's using to aggregate her badges) and say, "Please give me a token I can attach to this review to show that I have an Expert Experimentalist badge"?  The token would be digitally signed, so that people could confirm its authenticity, but no personal identification.</p>
<p>By analogy with Peter Wayner's "translucent databases", we can think of these tokens as "translucent badges": they let some light through, but they're not completely transparent.  I can see lots of other ways they'd be useful.  For example, I would really like to know whether a lengthy comment on Slashdot about software patents was written by a patent lawyer or a teenager in a basement in Saskatchewan&mdash;except what I <em>really</em> mean is, "I'd like to know how much the commenter knows about the subject," because that kid in Saskatchewan just might be a self-taught expert.  Badges give <em>her</em> a way to validate her expertise; translucency would give her a way to share it more safely.</p>
