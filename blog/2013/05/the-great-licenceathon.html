<blockquote>
  Intellectual Property (IP) is a thorny issue in academia,
  generally because people don't know who owns what.
  There's a lot of hearsay, rumour and&mdash;frankly&mdash;misunderstanding about IP ownership,
  so we've decided to run an experiment.
  And we're going to need some guinea pigs&hellip;
  <br/>
  &hellip;
  <br/>
  To get a better understanding of how academia deals with IP ownership,
  we're want to run The Great Licenceathon.
  This will see people at different organisations working out who owns their IP.
  They'll then blog about their experiences
  and we'll pick through those blogs
  to see whether there's some common lessons we can learn.
  <br/>
  &hellip;
  <br/>
  If you want to know who owns your IP,
  and you have time to ask a few questions at your organisation,
  then please <a href="mailto:info@software.ac.uk">get in touch</a>.
</blockquote>
<p>
  I think this information will be extremely useful,
  not least because we're thinking about adding discussion of licensing and open access
  to the "day 3" material for our boot camps.
