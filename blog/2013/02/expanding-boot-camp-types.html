<p>Prompted by a recent email I gave some thought to our plans to expand the
types of boot camps we offer, especially when it comes to a sort of "next
level" boot camp and whether we might offer boot camps that introduce
traditional software developers to the world of scientific programming:</p>

<p>There is significant discussion on the best way to expand Software
Carpentry. Longer boot camps, advanced boot camps, etc. At some point we need
to start actually experimenting with these things, but we have many
constraints, most notably a severe shortage of person-hours to devote to
developing curriculum and staffing events. Scientists, it turns out, are very
busy people!</p>

<p>We focus on teaching software engineering to scientists, but I think it
would be an interesting experiment to try to identify the overlapping interests
of Software Carpentry graduates and web developers and run a boot camp based on
that. I could see people getting a lot out of the co-mingling at such an
event.</p>

<p>Picking curriculum could be a challenge. Do we keep it general or pick a
subfield? Even in our regular boot camps we find it useful to change lessons
based on the audience. Biologists are into SQL, physicists more interested in
fast numeric processing. And the more specific we make things the fewer people
we interest. My mind goes immediately to scientific Python but then that's
my specialty.</p>

<p>If you have thoughts on what to teach in a "next level" boot
camp please leave them in the comments, and if you'd like to host one
please <a href="mailto:{{contact_email}}">get in touch</a>!</p>
