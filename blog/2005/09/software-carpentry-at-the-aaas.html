<p>I just received word that I'll be running a workshop on the aims, benefits, and curriculum of the Software Carpentry course at the <a href="http://www.aaas.org/meetings/Annual_Meeting/">Annual Meeting</a> of the <a href="http://www.aaas.org">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a> in St Louis on Friday, February 17.  The AAAS AM is the biggest gathering of scientists in the world; I'm pretty excited.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Michael Hoffman is teaching a <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~hoffman/presentations/">short course on Python</a> at the European Bioinformatics Institute in Cambridge, England, based on the course notes. 24 people are now enrolled in the course at the University of Toronto, 47 are auditing locally, and 21 others are sitting in from other locations. (These number don't include the students enrolled in the course at Indiana University, or the study group at CalTech.)  Oh, and 38 students have already submitted Exercise 1, even though it isn't due until 5:00 Friday ;-).</p>
