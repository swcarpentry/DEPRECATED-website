<p>Matt Davis (who works at the Space Telescope Science Institute, and has become one of our regular instructors) taught three boot camps in eight days back in October. He has finally recovered enough to <a href="http://penandpants.com/2012/11/12/software-carpentry-california-tour-2012/">write a description</a> of what he did, how it went, and what he learned. The two biggest lessons are:</p>
<ul>
        <li>Try to get to know your audience beforehand by talking to organizers and/or using surveys.</li>
        <li>Try to plan boot camps so that the students come from similar backgrounds and, if possible, the same department or lab.</li>
</ul>
