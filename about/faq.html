<p id="what-is-swc"><em><strong>What is Software Carpentry?</strong></em></p>

<p>The goal of Software Carpentry is to make scientists and engineers
more productive by teaching them basic computing skills like program
design, version control, testing, and task automation&mdash;things they
should know <em>before</em> they try to tackle anything with "peta" or
"cloud" in its name. Since 1997, we have found that a few days of
training can save researchers a day a week for the rest of their
professional lives, and also improve the quality of their
computational work. Rather than adopting a position of <em>these
skills are good because software developers say they are</em>,
Software Carpentry teaches the software skills in the context of how
they contribute to correct, reproducible and reusable research.</p>

<p id="team"><em><strong>Who created all this?</strong></em></p>

<p><a href="{{root_path}}/about/team.html">Many people</a> have helped
by creating content, teaching boot camps, and building this web
site.</p>

<p id="who-funds-swc"><em><strong>Who pays for it?</strong></em></p>

<p>Over a <a href="{{root_path}}/about/credits.html">dozen
organizations</a> have supported us since we ran our first class
at <a href="http://lanl.gov">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a> in
1998.  Our current work is sponsored by
the <a href="http://www.sloan.org">Alfred P. Sloan Foundation</a> and
the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/">Mozilla
Foundation</a>.</p>

<p id="what-is-boot-camp"><em><strong>What is a boot camp?</strong></em></p>

<p>A boot camp is an in-person, example-driven workshop, typically two
or three days long. A boot camp covers the core skills needed to be
productive in a small research team: basic programming skills, version
control, testing, using the shell, and relational databases.</p>

<p>Short tutorials alternate with hands-on practical exercises, and
participants are encouraged both to help one another, and to try
applying what they have learned to their own research problems during
and between sessions. Participants usually work on their own computers
(typically laptops), using either native software or a standard set of
packages running in a virtual machine. This ensures that they have a
working environment when the boot camp is done.</p>

<p id="why-boot-camp"><em><strong>Why boot camps?</strong></em></p>

<p>Software Carpentry was originally taught using in-lab lectures, but
we have been experimenting since 2007 with various forms of online
delivery. Our experience is consistent with recent research: students
learn best in a <em>blended</em> environment that combines directed
in-person instruction with self-directed online learning. We have
therefore borrowed the boot camp format used so successfully by the
University of Wisconsin - Madison's <a href="https://github.com/thehackerwithin">Hacker Within</a>
group, and are using it as a lead-in to our online material.</p>

<p>As well as improving learning, boot camps solve two other recurring
problems. Researchers are busy people who often cannot make time for a
semester-long traditional course. However, most can find two or three
days to get started (and to get past installation and configuration
hurdles if they are working on their own machines). At the same time,
it can be hard to stay motivated when working in isolation; by
bringing people together, boot camps create help peer support
communities in selected disciplines or geographic regions.</p>

<p id="boot-camp-audience"><em><strong>Who are boot camps for?</strong></em></p>

<p>Our learners are typically graduate students in science,
engineering, and medicine who have written a few lines of code (either
on their own or for an "Intro to Computing" class as undergrads), but
aren't familiar with good "lab practices" in scientific computing like
version control or unit testing.  If any
of <a href="{{root_path}}/about/audience.html">these short bios</a>
sounds like you, then we're here to help.</p>

<p id="boot-camp-format"><em><strong>What does a typical boot camp look like?</strong></em></p>

<p>Boot camps are usually full-day affairs, starting at 8:30 and
running to 4:30 or 5:00 with breaks for coffee and lunch. They usually
have 20-50 participants and 2-3 instructors, plus a variable number of
helpers wandering the room answering questions during practical
sessions. (The instructors usually do this as well if their schedules
permit.)</p>

<p>Learners typically use their own laptop computers to do practical
exercises, though they may also use machines provided in a
departmental lab. Instructors and helpers are usually volunteers, and
participation is usually either free, or subject to a small fee to
cover the cost of refreshments.</p>

<p id="testimonials"><em><strong>Do boot camps really work?</strong></em></p>

<p>Yes: two independent studies in 2012 found that people really were
learning useful things, and
<a href="{{root_path}}/about/testimonials.html">these testimonials</a>
from past participants show just how much difference a little training
can make.</p>

<p id="how-attend-boot-camp"><em><strong>How can I attend a boot camp?</strong></em></p>

<p>Dates and venues of upcoming boot camps are on
our <a href="{{root_path}}/bootcamps/">calendar page</a>. They will also be announced on
our <a href="{{root_path}}/blog/">blog</a> and
on <a href="{{twitter_url}}">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p id="why-allow-attend-boot-camp"><em><strong>I'm a professor, why should I let my grad students attend a boot camp?</strong></em></p>
<p>
As our <a href="{{root_path}}/about/testimonials.html">testimonials</a> demonstrate, a boot camp can help researchers to improve their software development skills and so become more productive. Boot camps contribute to a researcher's personal career development (and can enhance their resume or CV). Researchers who have attended a boot camp are in a good position to help others in their research group adopt these software development skills too, to the benefit of their research group as a whole. 
</p>
<p>
Boot camps also provide researchers with the opportunity to meet and network with other researchers, and so to both learn about other research in their field and to, in turn, promote their research. Who knows, a 20 minute chat with a fellow attendee at a boot camp may result in the opportunity of a site visit or be the start of a long-term collaboration.

<p id="how-organise-boot-camp"><em><strong>How can I organise a boot camp?</strong></em></p>

<p>Anyone who wants to can organize and run a boot camp&mdash;all Software
Carpentry materials are freely available under a
<a href="{{root_path}}/license.html">Creative Commons license</a>,
so you are free to re-use and re-mix them when and how you
want. If you want to know more about what is involved in running a
boot camp, please see our guide on
<a href="{{root_path}}/bootcamps/how-to.html">how to run a boot camp</a>.</p>

<p>We support groups who want to organise a boot camp for their
institution or research community. We look for people who can act as
a <em>local organiser</em> who will handle the logistics of selecting
a suitable date, finding and booking a venue and catering, local
publicity, and finding a few researchers or students interested in
being helpers. Most importantly, a local organiser should be able to
gather a group of students, from their institution or community, to
attend the boot camp.</p>

<p>In return, we can help identify and arrange for instructors to come
and present lectures and lead practical sessions, we will also provide
guidance on how to organise the boot camp, help the local organiser to
promote it, and provide any other assistance that might be
required.</p>

<p>If you'd like us to help with planning, advertising, and
recruiting, please contact us by email
at <a href="mailto:{{contact_email}}">{{contact_email}}</a>.</p>

<p id="how-help-boot-camp"><em><strong>How can I help run a boot camp?</strong></em></p>

<p>Researchers attend boot camps, learn from them and become familiar
with how they are run. Ideally, we hope that some of those researchers
will attend future boot camps as helpers. Helpers provide support
during practicals to students (and get to add the experience to their
resume or CV). Eventually, we hope that some of the helpers will
become instructors, who will deliver lectures and run practicals at
future boot camps.</p>
