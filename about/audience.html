  <h2>Bhargan Basepair</h2>

    <div class="media-body">
    <p>Bhargan Basepair received a B.Sc. in biochemistry five years ago. She
    has worked since then for Genes'R'Us, a biotech firm with labs in four
    countries. She did a Java programming course as a freshman, and a
    bioinformatics course using Perl as a senior, but has no other training in
    programming.</p>
    <p>Bhargan and her colleagues are developing fuzzy pattern-matching
    algorithms for finding similarities between DNA records in standard
    databases. To help other Genes'R'Us researchers, and to test her group's
    heuristics, Bhargan runs an overnight sequence query service. Researchers
    email sequences in a variety of formats (in-line, attachments, URLs to
    pages behind the company firewall, etc.). Bhargan saves them in files
    called <code>search/a.in</code>, <code>search/b.in</code>, and so on, then
    edits them to add query directives. She almost never accidentally
    overwrites one query with another.</p>
    <p>Before leaving each night, she runs a Perl script that processes these
    input files to create output files with matching names
    like <code>search/a.out</code>. When Bhargan comes in the next morning,
    she pages through her mail again, sending <code>.out</code> files to the
    appropriate people. (She almost never sends the wrong file to the wrong
    person.) She uses another Perl script to copy all the input and output
    files to a directory named after the date, such
    as <code>2009-07-23</code>. She and her colleagues would like to do
    statistics on these saved queries and results to see how well their
    algorithms are doing, but haven't yet found the time.</p>
    <p>This course will teach Bhargan how to automate her overnight service by
    writing simple scripts to retrieve, process, and reply to email
    queries. Those scripts will automatically record queries, results, and
    other data, and produce a daily summary of the performance of the
    pattern-matching algorithms.</p>

    <div class="media-body">
    <p>Fan Fullerene is a graduate student in chemistry who is working as a
    lab technician to help cover his costs. His only programming experience is
    a general first-year introduction to computational science using
    Python.</p>
    <p>Fan's supervisor is studying the production of fullerenes (also known
    as "buckyballs"). Each set of experiments involves 100 different reactant
    mixtures, 20 different temperature regimes, and 5 different
    pressures. Using a machine built by a collaborating lab, Fan can run all
    the mixture and temperature combinations at once, so that the output of
    each experiment is five 2000-line files.</p>
    <p>The controller for the experimental machine writes these files to Fan's
    workstation approximately an hour after the experiment begins. Fan
    analyzes them by opening Excel, copying and pasting the data into one big
    spreadsheet, then creating a chart using the chart wizard. He then saves
    the chart as a PNG file on the group's web site, along with the original
    data files.</p>
    <p>Two or three times a week, Fan receives results from his supervisor's
    collaborators. He creates charts for each using the same procedure,
    uploads them to the web site, and then merges summary statistics from the
    week's runs into a master spreadsheet.</p>
    <p>This course will teach Fan how to automate the process described above,
    and how to track the provenance of the data he is working with so that
    scientists can trace backward from the final charts to the raw data they
    represent. This course will also teach him how to create an RSS feed of
    results so that other scientists can automatically be notified as new data
    appears, and how to annotate the data to make it more searchable.</p>

  <h2>Helen Helmet</h2>

    <div class="media-body">
    <p>Helen Helmet, a Ph.D. student in mechanical engineering, is currently
    doing a six-month internship at an engineering firm that makes
    carbon-fiber helmets for firefighters and other emergency service
    personnel. Her undergraduate courses included an introduction to
    scientific computing using MATLAB, a robotics course using C, and a
    numerical methods course that also used MATLAB. She taught herself Fortran
    during a co-op placement between her junior and senior years, and used it
    again in a graduate course on finite elements.</p>
    <p>Helen's task is to model the non-combustive thermal degradation
    (otherwise known as "melting") of candidate materials. Her starting point
    is a 14,000-line program her supervisor wrote a decade ago. She copies the
    existing mesh deformation function to create a new one
    called <code>MDFORM2</code>, replaces all the calls to the original, and
    starts tinkering with the new function. She sometimes writes, runs, and
    deletes sections of code three or four times before she is satisfied.</p>
    <p>Helen tests her program by writing the total heat content of the mesh
    at each time step to a file. She then loads this data into MATLAB to graph
    the percentage differences between these values and the ones produced by
    the original program for six sample problems. In one case, the difference
    grew as large as 30% by the end of the simulation. Helen
    added <code>write</code> statements to her program to display values until
    she managed to convince herself that the difference was due to a bug in
    the original subroutines, not in her new code.</p>
    <p>This course will teach Helen how to do exploratory programming in a
    disciplined way, and that version control systems are a better way to
    manage code than copying, pasting, and commenting out. She will also learn
    more effective testing and debugging procedures.</p>

  <h2>Mehrdad Mapping</h2>

    <div class="media-body">
    <p>Mehrdad Mapping is a graduate student in forestry studying bark beetle
    infestations in the Canadian taiga. He has never taken a programming
    course, but used SPSS in an undergraduate statistics course.</p>
    <p>For the last three years, Mehrdad has spent six weeks every autumn
    counting beetle bores in pine trees in the Yukon and Alaska. He now has a
    spreadsheet with 15,000 entries, each recording the location and time of a
    measurement, the number of bores found, the moisture and acidity of the
    soil, and so on. He also has two hundred text files containing 17,500
    measurements that his supervisor made in the same regions in the 1970s and
    1980s. His task now is to put both sets of measurements on a map so that
    he can start to correlate changes in bark beetle distribution with changes
    in climate.</p>
    <p>This course is probably too advanced for Mehrdad, as it assumes
    familiarity with basic programming concepts like loops, conditionals,
    arrays, and functions. He should probably audit a first-year introduction
    to programming or find an intensive two-week summer school course before
    tackling this one.</p>
