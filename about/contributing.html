<p>Software Carpentry is an open project. Like all such projects, it needs your
help to grow, and you can contribute in many ways, large and small.</p>

    <p>All of our slides, notes, and example programs are in our Git
    repository
    at <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/website">https://github.com/swcarpentry/website</a>,
    and you are free to use them however you want (so long as
    you <a href="{{root_path}}/license.html">give us attribution</a>).
    Everything is designed so that individuals can work through what they need
    on their own, but universities, research labs, companies, and self-study
    groups have also used it in week-long crash courses and as part of longer
    classroom courses.</p>

    <p>If you would like to deliver the course (as a Software Carpentry
    instructor or on your own) in one of these formats, or in one we haven't
    seen yet, please <a href="#discuss">let us know</a>&mdash;we'd be glad to
    provide you with training or advice.</p>

      We run an online training course to help people become
      instructors.  The course requires 2-4 hours/week for 8-10 weeks,
      and covers the basics of educational psychology, instructional
      design, and how to apply both to teaching programming to
      scientists.  To find out more,
      visit <a href="http://teaching.software-carpentry.org">the
      course website</a>.
